## Overview
The **Distributed Computational Simulation Hypothesis (DCSH)** proposes that if reality is a simulation, it operates not through a centralized “god server,” but as a **distributed computing network** where each conscious entity functions as a **node** providing the computational power necessary to render its own experiential environment.  

This decentralized design solves the **scalability problem** of a universe-sized simulation by offloading computation to the participants themselves — similar to how **SETI@home** leveraged volunteer computing power to process astronomical data.  

In this model:
- Each conscious being provides **local compute** for its perception and interactions.  
- A shared **Rules Layer** synchronizes universal constants (e.g., conservation laws, causality, shared social state).  
- Biological energy and attention serve as **computational currency**, powering the rendering of reality.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Edge Rendering
Each conscious entity renders its immediate environment; only observed regions require high-resolution simulation.  

### 2. Rules Layer Coordination
A minimal invariant framework maintains global coherence — physics, causality, and social information consistency.  

### 3. Attention as Compute
Attention acts as a signal directing local processing resources.  
Biological energy expenditure (glucose, fatigue, sleep) mirrors computational cost.

### 4. Metabolic Cost = Compute Cost
Cognitive fatigue corresponds to processing limits; biological rest resets available processing capacity.

## Distinctions from Prior Work
| Model | Core Idea | Difference from DCSH |
|-------|------------|-----------------------|
| **Bostrom’s Simulation Argument** | We might be living in a simulation created by advanced beings. | DCSH focuses on *how* it could work — through participant-provided compute. |
| **Digital Physics / Pancomputationalism** | The universe is fundamentally computational. | DCSH proposes a *distributed architecture* with conscious nodes as processors. |
| **Idealism / Solipsism** | Reality is mental or mind-dependent. | DCSH maintains shared synchronization between independent nodes. |

## Predictions / Potential Signatures
1. **Attention–Resolution Coupling** — increased perceptual or neural activity tied to focus intensity.  
2. **Discretization Floors** — physical evidence of quantized space/time or computational “grain.”  
3. **Synchronization Stress Events** — rare global anomalies under high correlation (possible “Mandela-type” effects).  
4. **Energy–Complexity Scaling** — predictable relationship between cognitive energy and environmental complexity.

## Implications
- **Attention = Energy = Currency**  
  Whoever controls collective attention controls computation flow.  
- **Health = Hardware Maintenance**  
  Sleep and nutrition sustain local processing stability.  
- **Ethics**  
  Manipulating attention for profit or propaganda equates to exploiting computational resources of others.
